// The EFFORT SLIDER grammar — the one Claude screen the generic menu can see but cannot read.
//
// `/effort` paints a modal with no options and no highlight: a full-width rule, the title `Effort`,
// a `───` scale carrying a single `▲` marker, a row of labels under it, and the key-hint footer
//
//     ←/→ to adjust · Enter to confirm · s for this session only · Esc to cancel
//
// The generic grammar (menu.ts) claims this screen and gets two of its four affordances right. It
// misses the other two, and neither miss is fixable there:
//
//   * THE VALUE. `MENU_ARROW_ROW` is scanned across the region's rows only, strictly ABOVE the
//     footer — and here the `←/→` phrase IS the footer, so the generic detector finds no arrow row
//     and `nav.leftRight` stays undefined, i.e. no Left/Right buttons at all. Applying
//     MENU_ARROW_ROW to the footer line instead would be worse than nothing: it matches, with an
//     EMPTY value and a "verb" that is the whole rest of the footer. The value on this screen is not
//     written in words anywhere; it is the COLUMN of the `▲` against the label row. Reading a
//     position is a Claude-specific act, so it belongs in a Claude-specific detector (ADR 0053).
//   * THE `s` KEY. `parseKeyHintFooter` needs the literal word `to` between key and verb, and this
//     screen writes `s for this session only`. Widening that shared grammar to accept `for` would
//     loosen every adapter's footer parsing for one screen's wording, so the segment is read here.
//
// Everything else is inherited: this detector emits the SAME `MenuModel`, so it renders through
// `MenuBlock` with no new component, and it takes the identity comparator and the race guard as they
// stand. That pairing is what makes the arrows safe — `menusSameIdentity` deliberately ignores
// `nav.leftRight.label` (menu-model.ts:72-86), so a tap that moves the `▲` is the expected outcome
// rather than a stale-screen abort, while `menusEqual` folds in the signature, so a marker that
// moved under the operator still aborts a COMMITTING key.
//
// POSITION-INDEPENDENT BY CONSTRUCTION. Nothing below names a column number, a pane width or a label
// set: the marker row is found by its glyph, the label row by adjacency, and the value by nearest
// label centre. Two captures of this screen at different widths are in the corpus for exactly that
// reason.
//
// NO DIGITS, and nothing the screen did not print (.adr/0009): the emitted keys are `Enter`, `s` and
// `Escape`, all three named in the footer, plus the `Left`/`Right` the footer advertises with `←/→`.
// The operator reaches `low` from `xhigh` by tapping Left, never by Collie typing a key that means
// "jump to low".
//
// Pure functions over `StyledLine[]`, tail-anchored like every other Claude grammar.

 * Ordered bails, cheapest and most decisive first:
 *   1. the last non-blank line parses as a key-hint footer AND advertises `←/→` with a verb — this
 *      is the screen's own claim that the arrows do something, and no other capture in the corpus
 *      makes it from its footer;
 *   2. there must be NO input box at the tail, for the reason menu.ts:79 has the same bail: fake
 *      buttons under a live composer are worse than no buttons;
 *   3. exactly one row of the region carries exactly one `▲`, and the FIRST non-blank row beneath it
 *      splits into two or more labels, each carrying a word. First row, not any row: the row under
 *      the labels is a DESCRIPTION line ("xhigh + workflows"), and a detector that took every row
 *      would try to read it as labels too. Each carrying a word, because on a pane too narrow for
 *      the slider the row under the marker is the scale's own wrapped continuation;
 *   4. the region's opening rule / border is found the way menu.ts:84-89 finds it, and the first
 *      non-blank row under it is the title;
 *   5. the marker picks ONE label clearly — the nearest label centre beats the second-nearest by at
 *      least a display cell. A near-tie is not a value, it is a different layout.
 *
 * Pure; the caller owns pane access.
