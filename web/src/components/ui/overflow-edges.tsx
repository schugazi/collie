// A SIDEWAYS SCROLLER THAT SAYS WHICH WAY IT SCROLLS — the fade and a chevron on the edge that
// actually hides something, and on no other edge.
//
// The composer's two strips (the actions row and the key rail) are wider than a phone. On a Claude
// Code pane at 390px the general capsule alone measures ~396px against a ~382px row, so the harness
// capsule is entirely off-screen at rest and the row looks like it ENDS at the last visible pill.
// The old cue was STRIP_SCROLLER's edge mask, which faded BOTH ends unconditionally — including the
// left, where nothing was hidden — so the one thing it said, it said in both directions at once,
// and a fade alone was too quiet to read as "flick me". Altan, on his phone: "it should be a bit
// clearer now though that this bar is scrollable."
//
// IT MEASURES, IT DOES NOT GUESS. `scrollLeft`, `clientWidth` and `scrollWidth` are read on mount,
// on every `scroll` (passive), and whenever the scroller or its content changes size. A locale
// change needs no listener of its own: the words re-render, the content box changes, and the
// ResizeObserver reports it. The answer is written on the wrapper as
// `data-overflow="none|left|right|both"`, so the playground and the tests read one attribute rather
// than sniffing for a class.
//
// WHY A RENDER PROP and not `cloneElement` or a `scrollerRef` prop like LabelledStrip's. The state
// and the ref are one thing — the element measured IS the element the state describes — so the
// primitive owns both and hands the ref out. `cloneElement` would type-check nothing: hand it a
// component instead of a host element and the ref silently goes nowhere, with a row that never
// fades again and no error anywhere. A `scrollerRef` prop splits the pair: the caller would create
// the ref, and a caller that forgets to attach it gets the same silent nothing. `LabelledStrip`
// keeps its prop because there the ref is the CALLER's (it drives the scroll position from the
// outside); here it is ours.
//
// NOTHING ANIMATES, so there is nothing to gate on `prefers-reduced-motion`: no nudge, no bounce,
// no sliding chevron. The mask and the chevron appear and disappear, and that is all.
//
// THE CHEVRON IS OPT-OUT, via `cue`. The bare glyph is `"soft"`, the default, and every caller keeps
// it unless it asks for `"none"`. The actions belt tried a bigger, darker glyph on its own chrome
// patch (`"strong"`) for one commit, against Altan's verdict from the phone that the bare glyph was
// "barely visible" over the belt's tint — but the fix Altan actually wanted, on reflection, was no
// chevron at all: the tint and the fade already say the row scrolls, and a chevron the fixed Switch
// pill's own hit box then overlapped was unreachable besides. `"none"` draws the fade masks and no
// glyph; `actions-row.tsx` is the one caller that asks for it.

 *     margin and no height of its own.

 *     element's whole subtree, and the chevron sits 4px from an edge the fade has already taken to
 *     ~17% alpha — masked with the pills, it would be invisible exactly where it is needed.
 *  3. The CHEVRONS, when `cue` draws one, are absolutely positioned against the outer box, so they
 *     take no layout space and the row's height and the pills' positions are identical in every
 *     state (DESIGN.md §2, the no-shift rule). `pointer-events-none` keeps them from eating a tap
 *     meant for the pill underneath, and `aria-hidden` keeps them out of the accessibility tree — a
 *     screen reader gets the buttons themselves, which were never hidden from it. `cue="none"` skips
